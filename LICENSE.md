## 📄 Building a Smart PDF Reader with LangChain and Streamlit

This project is all about creating a smart, interactive PDF reader that lets users upload PDFs and chat with a **bot** about the document content. We’re using **LangChain** to integrate the chatbot and **Streamlit** to build a sleek, interactive web app. Ready to explore the future of document interaction? Let’s go! 💬📑

## Project Overview

The aim is to develop a web-based PDF reader with a built-in chatbot. The system allows users to upload any PDF, and the chatbot answers questions by retrieving relevant sections from the document. The chatbot is powered by **GPT-3.5/GPT-4**, and the project uses **LangChain** to connect everything seamlessly.

We’ll build the frontend using **Streamlit**, and display the relevant pages of the PDF using an iframe for added context. The chatbot will create text embeddings to find the most accurate answers. This project offers a glimpse into how language models can enhance user interaction with documents!

### Key Features:

- 📄 **PDF Upload**: Users can upload any PDF file into the app.
- 🤖 **Interactive Chatbot**: Ask questions about the content of the PDF and get answers powered by GPT-3.5/GPT-4.
- 🔍 **Text Embeddings**: Use Chroma for creating embeddings and accurately retrieving relevant content from the PDF.
- 📚 **Contextual Pages**: The relevant pages of the PDF are displayed in an iframe along with the chatbot's response.
- 🎨 **Simple Frontend**: A clean and functional frontend built with Streamlit.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **LangChain**: Framework for building and integrating the chatbot.
- **Streamlit**: For building the user interface.
- **GPT-3.5/GPT-4**: Large language models for generating answers.
- **Chroma**: For creating embeddings of the PDF text.
- **Hugging Face**: Used to assist with NLP-related tasks.
- **Python**: The programming language that ties it all together.

## 🤖 Skills Applied

- Deep Learning
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Prompt Engineering
- Web Development with Streamlit

## Example Tasks You Can Do

- **Chat with PDFs**: Upload a PDF and ask the chatbot questions about its content.
- **Search PDF Content**: Retrieve relevant information from specific sections of the PDF.
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Use a Streamlit-built interface to interact with your documents effortlessly.
